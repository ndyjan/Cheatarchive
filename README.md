# Fortnite Cheatarchive

```
Some leaked sources. Fortnite ext/int, Spoofer perm/temp Valorant ext/int.
```
> [!Note]
> These sources are all leaked nothing here is "UD" or updated you will have to change some stuff to make it good.
 
> [!Warning]
> Doublecheck for rats! These sources are just reposted and sorted out (check .vcxproj file for externally downloads, .lib files)

# The sources are heavily outdated after the newest update so you will have to implement this into your paste to get it working.
> Main.cpp: (code to read out "dynamic_uworld" this it very important!)
```c++
__int64 va_text = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
	if ((read<__int32>(virtualaddy + (i * 0x1000) + 0x250)) == 0x260E020B)
	{

		va_text = virtualaddy + ((i + 1) * 0x1000);
		dynamic_uworld = offset::uworld + va_text;
	}
}
```

> Cache.h (read uworld using the premade "dynamic_uworld")
```c++
arrays->uworld = driver.read<uintptr_t>(dynamic_uworld);
```

> Offsets.h (just definition (you can also define it somewhere else))
```c++
__int64 dynamic_uworld;
```

```json
dynamic_uworld tested (25.07.24)
state: Working
```
